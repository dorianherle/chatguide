# Fresh Start

This is a clean slate for new development.

## Gemini Sample

See `gemini_sample.py` for a minimal example of how to talk to Google's Gemini AI.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set your Gemini API key in `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Run the sample: `python gemini_sample.py`

## Old Code

Your previous code is preserved in the `main` branch. You can access it anytime with:
```bash
git checkout main
```
